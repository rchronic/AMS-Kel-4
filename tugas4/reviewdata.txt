The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .

It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .

This really is a laptop in a small form .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .

It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .

This really is a laptop in a small form .

The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .

I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .

It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .

This really is a laptop in a small form .

The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .

I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .

The sound is great , not as good as my $ 1000 each Klipsch R7s , but come on , for the size and price , you will not beat these units .

The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

Hi , I just got this , and let me tell you is an awsome monitor , Size , looking and 3d is awsome good with this LCD .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .

It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .

This really is a laptop in a small form .

The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .

I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .

The sound is great , not as good as my $ 1000 each Klipsch R7s , but come on , for the size and price , you will not beat these units .

The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .

Hi , I just got this , and let me tell you is an awsome monitor , Size , looking and 3d is awsome good with this LCD .

Apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .

It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .

This really is a laptop in a small form .

The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .

I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .

The sound is great , not as good as my $ 1000 each Klipsch R7s , but come on , for the size and price , you will not beat these units .

The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .

Hi , I just got this , and let me tell you is an awsome monitor , Size , looking and 3d is awsome good with this LCD .

Apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .

The full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color .

You can also use a 6v DC power supply -LRB- not included -RRB- Cons : - Bad Instructions ; like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and , in this case , erroneously lists the power requirements as AC when it should be DC .

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .

The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .

One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

We count on good products at a good price .

The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .

I was pleased with its operation before the attempted firmware update .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .

It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .

This really is a laptop in a small form .

The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .

I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .

The sound is great , not as good as my $ 1000 each Klipsch R7s , but come on , for the size and price , you will not beat these units .

The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .

Hi , I just got this , and let me tell you is an awsome monitor , Size , looking and 3d is awsome good with this LCD .

Apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .

The full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color .

You can also use a 6v DC power supply -LRB- not included -RRB- Cons : - Bad Instructions ; like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and , in this case , erroneously lists the power requirements as AC when it should be DC .

The model is also very clean and nice , and the software is very user-friendly .

This little speaker has dynamite sound !!

The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .

The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .

The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .

I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .

Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .

Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .

Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .

Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .

The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .

The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .

Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .

This tiny speakers produce really big sound .

A great system at an incredible price .

A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .

The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .

Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .

My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .

These monitors are great for the price .

I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .

The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .

The USB port on the back is a nice feature .

This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .

I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .

While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .

The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .

However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .

As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .

- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .

The speaker arived in excellent condition .

Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

The sound this slim design puts out !!

For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .

Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .

recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly

3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .

Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .

The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .

Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .

This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .

I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .

In the end I would recommend that you go with a different router , If you decide to get this one , either never do a firmware update , or do it right away so that if the router fails , you are within the easy exchange period .

I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .

The remote control and reciever not so good .

I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!

The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .

Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .

When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .

The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .

- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .

We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .

Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .

First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .

Sound quality and base is amazing .

Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .

Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .

Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .

Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .

Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .

This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .

It has good color and price was great .

I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !

Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .

These are good looking , durable speaker stands .

Good monitor for the price .

The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .

I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .

This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .

This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .

Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .

I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch

Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .

Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .

You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .

Very happy with the monitor and the price ...

Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .

excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela

I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .

Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .

These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !

The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .

Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .

All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .

It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .

Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !

Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .

This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !

The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .

I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .

The rechargeable battery is a great feature .

The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .

Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .

The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .

I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .

The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!

Good range & speed .

That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .

The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .

If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .

I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models

The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...

I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .

An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .

I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .

Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .

The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .

However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .

Over for the price this is a good unit .

I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .

Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .

Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .

- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .

Overall , I like the system features and performance .

Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .

Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .

The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .

These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .

No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .

Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .

For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .

and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .

Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .

The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .

Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .

You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .

Sound is also nice as compared to its size .

Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .

I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .

The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .

This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .

D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .

Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .

It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .

This really is a laptop in a small form .

The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .

I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .

The sound is great , not as good as my $ 1000 each Klipsch R7s , but come on , for the size and price , you will not beat these units .

The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .

Hi , I just got this , and let me tell you is an awsome monitor , Size , looking and 3d is awsome good with this LCD .

Apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .

The full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color .

You can also use a 6v DC power supply -LRB- not included -RRB- Cons : - Bad Instructions ; like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and , in this case , erroneously lists the power requirements as AC when it should be DC .

The model is also very clean and nice , and the software is very user-friendly .

This little speaker has dynamite sound !!

The Center channel is JBL - S - Center II , this unit is very powerful and produces crystal clear dialogues , and it 's a 3-way speaker system .

Assembly of the stands is very straightforward , and well detailed in the instructions .
