volume[+1], vibration[-1], distortion[-1] ## The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .
printer sharing[+1], menu[+1] ## The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .
size[-1], sound[+1] ## The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages .
stands[+1], wire[+1] ## I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .
Sound[+1], look[+1] ## Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .
Sound[+1], bass[+1] ## Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .

sound quality[+1], volume[-1] ## Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .

speakers[+1], sound[+1] ## This tiny speakers produce really big sound .
system[+1], price[+1] ## A great system at an incredible price .
bass[+1], mids[-1] ## A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .
product[+1], quality[+1], weight[+1] ## The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .
monitor[+1], price[+1] ## Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .
product[+1], signal interruptions[+1] ## My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .
monitors[+1], price[+1] ## These monitors are great for the price .
controller[+1], volume knob[+1], selector buttons[+1] ## I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .

stereo separation[+1], bass level[+1] ## The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .
quality[+1], price[+1] ## However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .
D-Link DIR-655[+1], connections[+1] ## As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .
computer speaker[+1], bass[+1] ## - If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .
speaker[+1], condition[+1] ## The speaker arived in excellent condition .
volume[+1], bass[+1], mounting abilities[+1] ## Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .

screen[-1], picture quality[-1] ## When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .

Sound quality[+1], base[+1] ## Sound quality and base is amazing .

sound[+1], speaker[+1], Phillip speaker sound[+1] ## This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .
monitor[+1], speakers[+1] ## This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .
speakers[+1], Volume adjustment[-1] ## Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .
product[+1], price[+1] ## I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .

dead pixels[+1], color bleeding[+1] ## I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models
speakers[-1], monitor[-1] ## The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...
